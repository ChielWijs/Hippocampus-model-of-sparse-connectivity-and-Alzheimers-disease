# Hippocampus-model-of-sparse-connectivity-and-Alzheimers-disease
This repository contains the code that was used to generate the results of my Master's thesis titled "The Influence of Connectivity Sparseness and Alzheimer's Disease on Pattern Separation in a Spiking Neuron Model of the EC-DG-CA3 Hippocampal Circuit" 

## Package versions

The file "thesis.yml" contains a copy of the conda environment used for simulating the model.
The most important packages and their version are:
- nengo       2.8.0
- nengo-ocl   1.4.0
- python      3.7.9
